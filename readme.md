## What is this?

Just another starter-kit 🤷🏻‍♂️ for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) ready with:

- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
- [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org) (package bundler)
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Eva Icons](https://akveo.github.io/eva-icons/) and
- [Seed-CSS](http://rogeriotaques.github.io/seed-css/) (lightweight CSS boilerplate)

**Found a bug 🐞?**

- [Open an Issue](https://github.com/rogeriotaques/vue-start-kit/issues) and I'll take care of it
- Or you can fix it and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/rogeriotaques/vue-start-kit/pulls) 🙇‍♂️

## What do you get using this?

- 🚀 Start building your app super fast
- 🙌 Very clean and intuitive file structure
- 🔥 Live programing environment (with Hot Module Replacement)
- 🎯 Linter and Vue Coding Guidelines up an running
- 💪 A stable code-base with TypeScript
- 😇 No webpack config file
- ✅ A well commented and easy to understand source-code

## Get started

```sh
# 1. clone it
$ git clone https://github.com/rogeriotaques/vue-start-kit.git [YOUR-AWESOME-APP-NAME]

# 2. install all the dependencies
$ yarn  # or npm install

# 3. start the (live) development environment
$ yarn start  # or npm start
```

👉🏻 Don't forget to change `[YOUR-AWESOME-APP-NAME]` with the name you wanna give to your new app.

👉🏻 A new tab will open on your (default) browser pointing to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/). If this address is already in use, it will automatically choose another random port.

Hooray! 🎉 At this point we should be up and running.

From now on, everything you change in the `source-code` will trigger an imediate update on the browser (_without refresh_) preserving the current state of your newly created app.

## Building for production

Once your app is ready to be distributed, run:

```sh
$ yarn build  # or npm run build
```

This will create the `dist/` directory with all the transpiled files from your app, ready to be deployed to your servers. 🚀

## Contributing

Contributions are _very_ welcome and are expected to be made through [pull requests](https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit/pulls). As for now, I don't have any contribution guidelines in place, so, please don't be evil. 😉

You can simply start by:

1. Forking this repository;
2. Changing and implementing what you think necessary;
3. Implementing the Unit Tests (with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/));
4. Submitting a pull-request.

## Unit tests

The unit tests are written using `Jest` and they can be found in `__test__/`.

Run the following command to start executing the existing tests:

```sh
$ yarn test   # or npm run test
```
