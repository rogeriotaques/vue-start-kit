## What is this?

Just another starter-kit 😅 to bootstrap [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) applications, ready with:

- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
- [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org) (package bundler)
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Eva Icons](https://akveo.github.io/eva-icons/)
- [Seed-CSS](http://rogeriotaques.github.io/seed-css/) (lightweight CSS boilerplate)

## Why should you use this?

You may want to use this starter-kit to quickly bootstrap small and simple apps.

I've prepared it as a boilerplate app that is ready to easily get up and running with side projects without the need to go thru all the steps from the (official) vue-cli. Therefore, it might be kinda opinionated, but it's still super flexible for customizations.

Here's what you get in this bundle 👇

- 🚀 Quick to start coding your app (side projects?)
- 🙌 Very clean and intuitive file structure
- 🔥 Live programing environment (with Hot Module Replacement)
- 🎯 Linter and Vue Coding Guidelines up an running
- 💪 Pre configured unit tests
- 😇 No webpack config files
- ✅ Well commented and easy to understand source-code
- 💡 A sample (ToDo 🤷🏻‍♂️) app

## Get started

```sh
# 1. clone it
$ git clone https://github.com/rogeriotaques/vue-start-kit.git [YOUR-AWESOME-APP-NAME]

# 2. install all the dependencies
$ yarn  # or npm install

# 3. start the (live) development environment
$ yarn start  # or npm start
```

👉🏻 Don't forget to change `[YOUR-AWESOME-APP-NAME]` with the name you wanna give to your new app.

👉🏻 A new tab will open on your (default) browser pointing to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/). If this address is already in use, it will automatically choose another random port.

Hooray! 🎉 At this point we should be up and running.

From now on, everything you change in the `source-code` will trigger an immediate update on the browser (_without refresh_) preserving the current state of your newly created app.

## Building for production

Once your app is ready to be distributed, run:

```sh
$ yarn build  # or npm run build
```

This will create the `dist/` directory with all the compiled files from your app, ready to be deployed to your servers. 🚀

## Contributing

Contributions are _very_ welcome and are expected to be made through [pull requests](https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit/pulls). As for now, I don't have any contribution guidelines in place, so, please don't be evil. 😉

You can simply start by:

1. Forking this repository;
2. Changing and implementing what you think necessary;
3. Implementing the unit tests (with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/));
4. Submitting a pull-request.

## Unit tests

The unit tests are written using `Jest` and they can be found in `src/__test__`.

Run the following command to start executing the existing tests:

```sh
$ yarn unit   # or npm run test
```

## Found a 🐞 (bug)?

Shame on me! 😊 But you know, that may happen!

- [Open an Issue](https://github.com/rogeriotaques/vue-start-kit/issues) and I'll take care of it
- Or you can fix it and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/rogeriotaques/vue-start-kit/pulls) 🙇‍♂️

## Where this's been used?

I'm using this starter-kit on these projects 👇

<p ><br ></p>

<table style="width: 100%;">
  <tbody >
    <tr >
      <td >
        <a href="https://mailshld.com" title="Mail Shield" >
          <img src="https://mailshld.com/assets/images/logo-transparent@2x.png" alt="Mail Shield" height="40" style="vertical-align: middle" /></a>
      </td>
      <td >Mail Shield</td>
      <td >Dynamic aliases for Gmail.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr >
      <td >
        <a href="https://3o2.co" title="3o2, The API based URL shortener" >
          <img src="https://3o2.co/assets/images/logo-thin.png" alt="3o2" height="40" style="vertical-align: middle" /></a>

## Help me keeping improving it! 🙏

I make this project 100% on my spare time. And even though this page (and the source-code) is hosted on Github, free of charge, coding and maintaining it consumes an important and precious resource of mine ... time.

So, if you think that all this effort is creating value in some way to you, be it helping you to bootstrap side-projects, quickly prototype and show up your next unicorn 🦄, etc, please consider contributing to keep me up! 💪

There're a few different ways you can contribute:

- Be my reviewer. Check my code and suggest improvements
- Be my sponsor with a single contribution of [$2.50](https://paypal.me/abtzlabs/2.5USD), [$5](https://paypal.me/abtzlabs/5USD) or [$10](https://paypal.me/abtzlabs/10USD) (via Paypal)
- Be my boss 😬, with a monthly [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/rogeriotaques) (via Github)
