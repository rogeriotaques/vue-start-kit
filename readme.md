## Why shuuld you use this?

You probably should not. Vue is already on v3 and this is based on v2.

But, you may find this useful if, for some reason, you want to quickly bootstrap a Vue 2 application. It comes with all the bare minium to code a SPA.

Here's what you get in this bundle 👇

- 🚀 Quick to start coding your app
- 🙌 Very clean and intuitive file structure
- 🔥 Live programming environment (with Hot Module Replacement)
- 🎯 Linter and Vue Coding Guidelines up an running
- 💪 Pre configured unit tests
- ✅ Well commented and easy to understand source-code
- 💡 A sample (ToDo 🤷🏻‍♂️) app

## Get started

```sh
# 1. clone it
$ git clone https://github.com/rogeriotaques/vue-start-kit.git [YOUR-AWESOME-APP-NAME]

# 2. install all the dependencies
$ yarn  # or npm install

# 3. start the (live) development environment
$ yarn start  # or npm start
```

👉🏻 Don't forget to change `[YOUR-AWESOME-APP-NAME]` with the name you wanna give to your new app.

👉🏻 A new tab will open on your (default) browser pointing to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/). If this address is already in use, it will automatically choose another random port.

Hooray! 🎉 At this point you should be seeing the app running already.

From now on, everything you change in the `source-code` will trigger an immediate update on the browser (_without refresh_) preserving the current state of your newly created app.

## Building for production

Once your app is ready to be distributed, run:

```sh
$ yarn build  # or npm run build
```

This will create the `dist/` directory with all the compiled files from your app, ready to be deployed to your servers. 🚀

## Contributing
